### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
<p> Given the instructions, I identified that the most critical part of this project was efficiently retrieving and handling the JSON data. I focused on implementing this in a clean, efficent way that the data loading process was reliable, fast, and well-tested. I looked for small areas where I could improve efficiency and maintainability without overcomplicating the solution. </p>

<p> In terms of user experience, I placed a strong emphasis on visuals. I believe that when it comes to recipes, images play a crucial role—seeing the dish is often more compelling than just reading the name. That’s why I prioritized making the images visible on the main list view. Additionally, I added a larger version of the image in the recipe detail view, along with an easy way to access the original source website. </p>

<p> For design, I aimed for a clean and rustic baking aesthetic. I chose the American Typewriter font to give it a warm, handcrafted feel, and used a minimal black-and-white color scheme to keep the focus on the recipes themselves. Overall, my goal was to create a smooth, functional experience that felt both practical and visually inviting. </p>
